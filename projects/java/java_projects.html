					<h3>Book Loader</h3>
					<p>In this project we built an application where we would read in a list of books from a csv file and then created a simple command line interface where a user could search, sell, and checkout a book into the "Book Store". This application was implemented by creating our own hashtable map. The books were add to a linked list based on the hashed index from their identification number. At worst case scenario all identification numbers would hash into the same index resulting on O[n] where n the number of items.</p>
					<h3>Movie Search</h3>
					<p> In this project we implemented a movie finder application where movies were read from an xml file. The movies were stored into a self-balancing Red Black tree where at worst case it was O(log n) to find a movie.</p>
